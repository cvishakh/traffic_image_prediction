# traffic_image_prediction
#Overview
Implemented precise PyTorchâ€‘based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for traffic image classification, using a custom-made classifier achieving 80% accuracy.

#dataset
consists of stop and not_stop image data. It can be read and loaded locally. 

#futher_scope
Use random images from the internet to check the classifier's accuracy and develop the model by adding new images to train and validate.
